The [EU-FOSSA](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eu-fossa-2/about) project developed by [European institutions](https://europa.eu/) is aiming at improving the security of Open Source Software.

As part of EU-FOSSA 2, the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/) is organising several [hackathons](https://eufossahackathon.bemyapp.com/) where developers from both the projects and the European Institutions that rely on their software, can come together.

With over 30 participants, the second hackathon focused on [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) projects.

It took place in Brussels on 4 and 5 May 2019.

During the hackathon, some of the most active developers from the Apache community got together, many for the first time. Their time together was spent working on important issues for the community and the EU institutions such as new features and security.

## Achievements

The participants worked on different activities, not only coding but also reflecting on different topics such as the Apache development process.
